Notes for Collaboration on this Feature


Description:
Adding this feature will allow the user to input feeding information for more than one dog.


To Do:
New input field (radio button or dropdown?) for Number of Dogs in Your Household (options: 1, 2, 3, 4)

Create new input fields x3 for meals per day and cups per meal. Should be a simple copy/paste and update IDs 

Hide all Meals per Day and Cups per Meal inputs until number of dogs input is selected

Introduce logic with JS function to determine which meals/cups inputs to display based on user input of dogs per household 

Update output message to include additional sentence about how many bags of food they will need per month

Be sure to send total values to the calculate function
