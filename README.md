# How long will a bag of dog food last? 

Starting as a personal project, simple, with limited scope.
I want to calculate how long a bag of dog food will last based on cups fed in a household per day. 
Could be expanded to calculate price / day and compare different brands.

This is helpful not only to know when to reorder, but for me to know when travelling if the bag I have will last the duration of the trip. 

# Technologies

I plan on using HTML, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. 
It will utilize HTML forms and JavaScript event listeners.
I'd also like to write my own unit tests for this application.
